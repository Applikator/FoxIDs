# Custom domain

Each FoxIDs tenant can be configured with a custom domain. The custom domain can be configured with [Control Client](control.md#foxids-control-client) and [Control API](control.md#foxids-control-api) in your tenants master track in the tenant settings.

If a new custom domain is added it needs to be verified and marked as verified in the master tenants master track before it is accepted by FoxIDs.

All custom domains on all tenants can be configured with [Control Client](control.md#foxids-control-client) and [Control API](control.md#foxids-control-api) in the master tenants master track. Where also the domain can be marked as verified at the same time.
