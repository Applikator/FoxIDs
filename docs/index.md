**FoxIDs is an open source identity service supporting login, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect 1.0, SAML 2.0 and convention between the standards.**

> STATUS: I'm currently working on the documentation and the first FoxIDs beta version.

FoxIDs consist of two services:
- Identity service called FoxIDs handling user login and all other security traffic.
- Client and API called FoxIDs Control. The FoxIDs Control Client is used to configure FoxIDs, or alternatively by calling the FoxIDs Control API directly.

FoxIDs is a cloud service ready to be [deployed in you Azure tenant](deployment.md). In the future, it will also be possible to use FoxIDs on [https://FoxIDs.com](https://foxids.com) for at small transaction fee.

> FoxIDs is free and open source, the GitHub repository is [https://github.com/ITfoxtec/FoxIDs](https://github.com/ITfoxtec/FoxIDs).  
The [license](../LICENSE) grant all (individuals, companies etc.) access to use FoxIDs for free. The license restricts reselling FoxIDs e.g. as a cloud service to third party for a fee, without a supplementary agreement.

> FoxIDs is .NET Core 3.1 and the FoxIDs Control Client is Blazor .NET Standard 2.1.
